`/config set notify:True` to notify the user that sent the phishing links in direct message about the action (kick)  
`/config set log_channel:#logs` to send logs of who got caught for phishing into `#logs`  
`/config set abusive_user_action:Ban` to ban members with known names and profile pictures of phishing accounts. Use `/check_members` to scan manually and take action
